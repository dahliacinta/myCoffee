# Coffee Catering Reservation System

## Introduction
The growth of small catering businesses has increased the need for an efficient reservation system, as many businesses still rely on manual bookings through phone calls or walk-ins. This often leads to issues such as lost reservations, pricing miscalculations and double bookings.

To address these problems, the Coffee Catering Reservation System was developed for Lands & People Cafe. This web-based system simplifies the reservation process by allowing users to choose predefined coffee catering packages based on their budget and event requirements.
